Martini 3 is a coarse-grained force field designed to simulate large biomolecular and soft-matter systems efficiently while preserving essential physics. As the successor to earlier Martini versions, it offers a practical balance between speed and realism, making it well suited for membranes, proteins, nucleic acids, polymers, and complex assemblies.

At its core, Martini 3 uses a four-to-one mapping on average: about four heavy atoms (plus hydrogens) become a single interaction site or “bead.” This reduction speeds up sampling and enables longer time and length scales. Interaction sites are organized into a small, systematic set that captures polarity and charge classes, supporting broad chemical coverage without sacrificing simplicity.

**Key advancements include:**
- Expanded chemical space and refined bead types, including higher-resolution beads for ring-like structures.
- Re-parameterization against experiments and atomistic data for better transferability and property reproduction (e.g., partitioning free energies, packing, and dynamics).
- Updated bonded and non-bonded potentials with improved electrostatics and hydrogen-bond representation for a more balanced interaction landscape.
- Greater flexibility for multi-scale setups, allowing adaptive levels of detail while retaining coarse-grained efficiency.

**Common applications span:**
- Membrane systems and protein–membrane interactions, including phase behavior and assembly.
- Protein conformational changes, association, folding motifs, and supramolecular organization.
- Nucleic acids and nucleic acid–protein complexes.
- Polymers, ionic liquids, self-assembly (micelles, vesicles, fibrils), and nanomaterials.
- Drug–membrane permeation, delivery mechanisms, and oil/water partitioning problems.

Recent studies have leveraged Martini 3 to generate long-timescale trajectories for drug–membrane permeation and other pharmaceutical questions, highlighting its utility for connecting molecular insight with practical design decisions.
