Chitosan is a versatile biopolymer derived from chitin, one of the most abundant natural polymers on Earth. Its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and unique physicochemical properties make it valuable for applications ranging from drug delivery and tissue engineering to food preservation and water treatment. However, chitosan's properties are highly sensitive to its degree of acetylation (DA)—the fraction of N-acetylglucosamine units along the polymer chain.

## A New Martini 3 Model

Our recent work published in *Biomacromolecules* presents a Martini 3 coarse-grained force field for chitosan that captures the effects of tunable acetylation. This model allows researchers to efficiently simulate chitosan systems at biologically relevant length and time scales while maintaining key structural and thermodynamic properties.

**Key features of the model include:**

- **Tunable acetylation**: The model supports chitosan with varying degrees of acetylation, enabling systematic study of how DA affects polymer behavior
- **Validated properties**: Parameterization against atomistic simulations and experimental data ensures accurate reproduction of structural characteristics, solubility behavior, and interactions with other biomolecules
- **Computational efficiency**: The coarse-grained approach enables longer simulations and larger systems compared to all-atom models, making it practical for studying complex assemblies and processes
- **Compatibility**: Full integration with the Martini 3 ecosystem allows simulations of chitosan interacting with membranes, proteins, nucleic acids, and other Martini 3 components

## Applications and Impact

This model opens new avenues for computational studies of:

- Chitosan self-assembly and aggregation in solution
- Interaction with cell membranes and membrane proteins
- Drug encapsulation and release mechanisms
- Complexation with nucleic acids for gene delivery
- Behavior at interfaces and in composite materials

By providing an efficient and accurate computational tool, this work supports the rational design of chitosan-based materials for biomedical and biotechnological applications.
